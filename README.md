### Just Enough Items

JEI support consists of a recipe handler for the Tesla Synthesizer.

**Disabling: Set the `enable_jei` key to `false` in the configuration.**

### What The Hell is That?

WTHIT support consists of an override handler for the Pitfall block to make it appear like regular grass blocks.

**Disabling: Set the `enable_wthit` key to `false` in the configuration.**

### Lucent

Lucent support consists of adding dynamic lighting to various aspects of the game.

**Disabling: Set the `enable_lucent` key to `false` in the configuration. Some more basic aspects are handled via
datapacks, so you will need to overwrite these as well.**

### Project MMO

PMMO support consists of EXP-granting events for crafting objects with the Small Parts Table or Tesla Synthesizer. More
events to come!

**Disabling: Set the `enable_pmmo` key to `false` in the configuration.**

## Version Support

Active development will always be focused on the latest Immersive Weapons version. Bugfixes may be ported to older
versions, but you should always upgrade when possible.

## Removed Mods

### Patchouli

Due to the lack of maintenance regarding newer versions and the sheer amount of work to maintain the books, it has been
removed. Please consider using the [Official Wiki](https://anonymoushacker1279.tech/wiki/immersiveweapons) instead.

*Do note that the wiki still requires a lot of work and there are missing entries. Please consider helping out!*
