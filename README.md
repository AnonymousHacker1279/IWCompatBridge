### Just Enough Items

JEI support consists of recipe handlers and information pages for custom crafting blocks.

### What The Hell is That?

WTHIT support consists of several elements. Those being:

- Display health and damage stages of damageable blocks (such as wooden spikes or barbed wire)
- Display cook/smelt time remaining of crafting blocks (such as the Tesla Synthesizer or Star Forge)
- Hide Pitfall blocks as regular grass blocks

### Curios

Curios support consists of slots for Immersive Weapons' accessory items. When Curios is loaded, items will no longer
need to sit in the inventory to work, and can instead be placed in the appropriate Curios slot.

### Mekanism

Mekanism support consists of ore processing recipes for cobalt materials.

### RyoamicLights

RyoamicLights support consists of adding dynamic lighting to various aspects of the game.

## Version Support

Active development will always be focused on the latest Immersive Weapons version. Bugfixes may be ported to older
versions, but you should always upgrade when possible.
